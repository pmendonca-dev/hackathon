# Decision Log

## Technical coverage objective

**Decision:** Primary product objective for the hackathon solution

**Options considered (one per line):**
Prioritize a distinctive business proposition
Prioritize the strongest technical capability with broad, efficient case coverage

**What we chose:** Prioritize building the tool with the strongest technical capability, designed to handle the largest practical set of cases efficiently, without business differentiation as the objective.

**Why:** The team selected technical breadth, robustness, and efficient handling of varied scenarios as the success criteria for the project. Business differentiation will not drive product decisions within this scope.

## Runtime and persistence foundation

**Decision:** Runtime and persistence foundation for the AVAL demonstration

**Options considered (one per line):**

Use the locally available Python 3.13 runtime with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and SQLite WAL
Adopt an AP2 reference application or SDK as the application foundation
Introduce a separate service or frontend stack before the authorization core exists

**What we chose:** Use Python 3.13 with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and SQLite WAL, with AVAL-owned domain and persistence code.

**Why:** The historical AP2 review identified Python as the compatible ecosystem while explicitly excluding its sample applications. SQLite WAL with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and a single writer is the documented demo boundary; it keeps durable authorization state local and leaves repositories isolatable for a later Postgres migration.
